Use caution when reading/interpreting/analyzing "grower_data_all."

It includes values unique to grower (e.g., bodyweight),
unique to grower-season (e.g., soil ingestion),
and unique to grower-season-activity (e.g., hours per month).

Data from the first two levels are repeated across rows,
so attempting to sum them, for example, would result in summing duplicate values.
